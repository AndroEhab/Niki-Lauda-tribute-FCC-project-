                    <h2>About Niki</h2>
                    <p>On February 22, 1949, Nicholas Andreas Lauda was born in Vienna into a prominent Austrian
                        business and banking dynasty. Paper manufacturing was how Niki's father made his fortune, though
                        none of it would be made available for a contrary son who would surely bring the respected Lauda
                        name into disrepute by playing at being a racing driver. To further educate himself in this
                        field Niki forsook university and enrolled himself in racing's school of hard knocks, paying for
                        it with money borrowed from Austrian banks. Starting in a Mini in 1968, he crashed his way
                        through Formula Vee and Formula Three and in 1972 he bought his way into the March Formula Two
                        and Formula One teams with another bank loan secured by his life insurance policy. The
                        uncompetitive Marches meant Niki was unable to prove his worth as a driver, let alone stave off
                        pending bankruptcy. With no qualifications in any other line of work he had no choice but to
                        keep on racing.
                    </p>
                    <p>For 1973 he talked his way into a complicated rent-a-ride deal with BRM. During that season his
                        ever-improving results paid dividends in the form of a new contract that would forgive his debts
                        in exchange for Niki staying with BRM for a further two years. Instead, he bought his way out of
                        BRM with money from his new employer Enzo Ferrari, for whom he went to work in 1974.
